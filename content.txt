##Scenario##
Build a tasklist system
Users need to be able to login
Users need to be able to Create, Update and delete tasklist
Each users tasks will be private to them (and can only be viewed by themselves)
We will set up the database for the backend, the web services and the authentication module

##What is REST##
REST => Representational state transfer.
A REST API is an interface that is stateless (Each request stands alone without knowledge
of previous requests).

It uses a CLIENT <-> SERVER model via REQUEST -> RESPONSE architecture.
It makes use of standard HTTP status codes and verbs like (CRUD):
POST    =   CREATE
GET     =   READ
PATCH   =   UPDATE
DELETE  =   DELETE

REST is not a standard or framework. It is merely a set of principles should follow to make it Restful

REST is preferred over SOAP due to its simpler implementation and uses JSON for the response output.
JSON is more simple than XML (which is what SOAP uses).

##What can you use an API for?##
1. Load and update data using a client application (mobile/desktop) to a back-end system.
2. Upload an image to a social network.
